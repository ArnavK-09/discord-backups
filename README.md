# @arnavk-09/discord-backups
`@arnavk-09/discord-backups` is an easy-to-use npm package for creating and loading backups of Discord servers. The package is built on top of the popular discord.js library and provides a streamlined interface for creating and restoring backups.
> Custom version of @Androz2091/discord-backup

## üì© Installation
You can install `@arnavk-09/discord-backups` using npm:
```bash
npm install @arnavk-09/discord-backups 
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Usage
To use this package first you have to import it
```js
const { createBackup, loadBackup, bkupUtils } = require("@arnavk-09/discord-backups");
```

#### createBackup(guild, options)
The createBackup function creates a backup of the specified Discord guild. It returns a promise that resolves with the backup data. You can then save this data to a file or database for later use.
```js
const backup = await createBackup(guild);
```

#### loadBackup(guild, backupData, options)
The loadBackup function restores a guild from a backup. It takes the guild object and backup data as parameters and returns a promise that resolves when the guild has been fully restored.
```js
await loadBackup(guild, backupData);
```
